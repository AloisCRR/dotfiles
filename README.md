# Dotfiles (Configuration files)

My Arch Linux config files

# Usage

- Clone the repo

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AloisCRR/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
  ```

- Create a symbolic link for every folder

  ```bash
  ln -sf ~/path/to/dotfiles/.config/* ~/.config/
  ```

## Root user folders config

`etc` and `xorg` folder files need root permissions. I'll try to order the folder as equal as it is in the linux folder, to only copy and paste.
